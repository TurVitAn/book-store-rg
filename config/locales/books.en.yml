          reviwer_message: If ‘Get a better job’ had landed on my desk a year ago, I might have been dismissive of it. Instead I was prepared to be open-minded. There have been many occasions where I turned to career books with practical activities to look for some inspiration when developing education activities for learners or assessment.
